\section{HTTP example}
\subsection{Who are you? Where are you?}
What is your own IP address? What is your own MAC address? What do theses commands display?
\begin{verbatim}
#ifconfig
$curl ifconfig.me
$netstat -at
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{ARP}
Before we can access the Internet we need to know who/what is the gateway. What is the IP address of yours? What is the MAC address? What do theses commands display?
\begin{verbatim}
#route -n
#arp -a
\end{verbatim}

\section{Chat}
\verb"netcat" is a "network swiss army knife". By checking its man page how can you use it as a chat server/client (two nodes only).
\subsubsection{TCP}
Use the mode TCP of \verb"netcat" and try it. Can \verb"netstat" could, somehow, be handful for anything while waiting for connection?
\subsubsection{UDP}
Use the mode UDP of \verb"netcat" and try it. Explain a situation within the server could not receive every packet.
